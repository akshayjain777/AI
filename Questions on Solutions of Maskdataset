Assumptions for Pearson r correlation and Spearsman rank correlation

Assumptions of Pearson r correlation:
For the Pearson r correlation, both variables should be normally distributed 
(normally distributed variables have a bell-shaped curve).  Other assumptions
include linearity and homoscedasticity.  Linearity assumes a straight line relationship 
between each of the two variables and homoscedasticity assumes that data is equally distributed 
about the regression line.

Assumptions of Spearsman correlation coeffiecient:
Spearman rank correlation: Spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that is used to measure
the degree of association between two variables.  The Spearman rank correlation test does not carry
any assumptions about the distribution of the data and is the appropriate correlation analysis when
the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal.

Note:
The assumptions of the Spearman correlation are that data must be at least ordinal and 
the scores on one variable must be monotonically related to the other variable.
