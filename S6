Assignment S6.

Make the file with your name and every thing should be like on on file where ever possible.








ur assignment 6 is:
take your 5th code
run your model for 25 epochs for each:
without L1/L2 with BN
without L1/L2 with GBN
with L1 with BN
with L1 with GBN
with L2 with BN
with L2 with GBN
with L1 and L2 with BN
with L1 and L2 with GBN
You cannot be running your code 8 times manually (-500 points for that). You need to be smarter and write a single loop or iterator to iterate through these conditions. 
draw ONE graph to show the validation accuracy curves for all 8 jobs above. This graph must have proper legends and it should be clear what we are looking at. 
draw ONE graph to show the loss change curves for all 8 jobs above. This graph must have proper legends and it should be clear what we are looking at. 
find any 25 misclassified images for "without L1/L2 with BN" AND "without L1/L2 with GBN" model. You should be using the saved model from the above jobs. 
and L2 models. You MUST show the actual and predicted class names.
make all the images available on Github Readme page, so you can upload the images for your assignment (you can upload them somewhere else as well for add image url).
submit the Github link for your notebook with logs, and also upload the images in the S6-Assignment Solution.
